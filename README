coned.py is a module for accessing Consolidated Edison of New York 
(coned.com)'s energy usage and billing history data.

ConedBill is a wrapper class for the energy usage history coming 
from ConEd's account management app.  It uses a simple POST request 
to retrieve the billing history page for a ConEd account number, 
parses the data, and formats it into an object.

The ConedBill instance can export the data as a Python dictionary,
raw CSV rows, or a JSON string representing the Python dictionary.

To use:
	cb = ConedBill('##########')
	cb.json
	cb.csv
	cb.dict
